/* bsock stack allocation for recvmsg() ancillary data
 * On Linux, maximum length of ancillary data and user control data is set in
 * /proc/sys/net/core/optmem_max (man 3 cmsg, man 7 socket); customarily 10240.
 * RFC 3542: Advanced Sockets Application Program Interface (API) for IPv6
 * RFC 3542 min ancillary data is 10240; recommends getsockopt SO_SNDBUF
 * (traditional BSD mbuf is 108, which is way too small for RFC 3542 spec)
 *
 * The reason this setting is important is because a client can send many file
 * descriptors.  On Linux, even if recvmsg() reports MSG_CTRUNC, the file
 * descriptors that the client sent are still received by the server process
 * (up to sysconf(_SC_OPEN_MAX)), resulting in leakage of file descriptors
 * unless process takes extra measures to close fds it does not know about.
 * Such an undertaking is difficult to do correctly since process might not
 * know which fds have been opened by lower-level libraries, e.g. to syslog,
 * nscd, /etc/protocols, /etc/services, etc.  Setting this buffer size to the
 * maximum allowed means that MSG_CTRUNC should not be possible.  (Take care
 * if increasing size since buffer is allocated on stack (as of this writing.)
 * On Linux, client can send the same descriptor many times and it will be
 * dup'd and received many times by server.  On Linux, there appears to be a
 * maximum of 255 file descriptors that can be sent with sendmsg() over unix
 * domain sockets, whether in one or many separate ancillary control buffers.
 * On Linux, these ancillary control buffers appear to be independent of
 * SO_RCVBUF and SO_SNDBUF sizes of either client or server; limiting size of
 * SO_RCVBUF and SO_SNDBUF has no effect on size of ancillary control buffers.
 * In any case, allocating /proc/sys/net/core/optmem_max for ancillary control
 * buffers prevents the possibility of MSG_CTRUNC on Linux.
